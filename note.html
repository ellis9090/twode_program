In the past years, we have worked as directors for the New Renaissance Theatre Company and we enjoyed it so much that we wanted to come and direct again! New Ren as always has been a great place to build up our experience and confidence even further.

We are so grateful to the cast, they are so talented and make the show what it is. They have poured so much time and energy into this play and I cannot imagine this production without them, they all are so talented and we want to thank you for coming to this show to celebrate them. To our crew, thank you so much for making the world of this show. We truly would not be able to have this vision play out on the stage without your effort. To the New Ren E-board, thank you for your continued support in and out of the rehearsal space.
<br>
		  <br>
And finally (this is actually the end I promise!): Thanks to you for showing up and taking the time to see all the hard work these amazing people have put into this play. Enjoy the show!

Brooke Caroom and Lexi Dressman, Co-Directors
